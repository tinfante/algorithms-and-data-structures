# Factorial

Differenet solutions to calculating n!, a number's factorial.


## Clojure

Typical recursive solution.
TODO: tail-optimized recursive solution (no stack overflow).


## Python

Functional solution.


## Javascript

The first solution is interesting in that it replaces recursion with an
explicit stack variable. It doesn't cause stack overflow like the second
typical recursive solution.
